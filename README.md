# FP-Growth Algorithm Implementation

This project implements the **FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) algorithm** for mining frequent itemsets from transactional data using Python. The implementation is validated with small illustrative examples and benchmarked on the real-world [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Overview

The FP-Growth algorithm is an efficient method for frequent pattern mining that:
- Uses a compressed FP-tree data structure to avoid costly candidate generation
- Mines frequent itemsets through pattern fragment growth
- Is significantly faster than the Apriori algorithm for large datasets
- Can generate association rules from discovered patterns

## Features

- **Complete FP-Growth Implementation**: Full implementation of the FP-growth algorithm with FP-tree data structure
- **Association Rule Generation**: Generates association rules with confidence metrics
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automated preprocessing pipeline for the Online Retail dataset
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Multiple test cases validating correctness
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Scalability analysis and performance metrics
- **Visualizations**: Automatic generation of performance charts and graphs

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ylc2001/ESE589-FP-growth-project.git
cd ESE589-FP-growth-project
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Basic FP-Growth Example

```python
from fp_growth import mine_frequent_itemsets

# Define transactions
transactions = [
    ['bread', 'milk'],
    ['bread', 'diaper', 'beer', 'eggs'],
    ['milk', 'diaper', 'beer', 'cola'],
    ['bread', 'milk', 'diaper', 'beer'],
    ['bread', 'milk', 'diaper', 'cola']
]

# Mine frequent itemsets
result = mine_frequent_itemsets(
    transactions, 
    min_support=0.4,  # 40% minimum support
    min_confidence=0.6,  # 60% minimum confidence
    return_rules=True
)

# Display results
print(f"Found {len(result['frequent_itemsets'])} frequent itemsets")
print(f"Found {len(result['rules'])} association rules")
```

### 2. Run Validation Tests

Validate the implementation with comprehensive test cases:

```bash
python validate.py
```

This runs 5 test suites:
- Simple transaction examples
- Classic textbook examples
- Edge cases (empty, single item, etc.)
- Support threshold variations
- Association rule generation

### 3. Run Benchmark Experiments

Run comprehensive experiments on the Online Retail dataset:

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

This will:
- Download and preprocess the Online Retail dataset
- Run support variation experiments (0.01 to 0.15)
- Run scalability experiments (500 to 5000 transactions)
- Generate association rules
- Create visualizations and save results

Results are saved to the `results/` directory:
- `support_variation_results.json`: Results for different support thresholds
- `scalability_results.json`: Results for different dataset sizes
- `association_rules_results.json`: Association rule mining results
- `support_variation.png`: Visualization of support experiments
- `scalability.png`: Visualization of scalability experiments
- `BENCHMARK_REPORT.md`: Comprehensive summary report

### 4. Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the Online Retail dataset separately:

```python
from preprocess import preprocess_online_retail

# Preprocess with 1000 transaction sample
transactions, trans_df, item_stats = preprocess_online_retail(
    sample_size=1000,
    min_items_per_transaction=2
)

print(f"Loaded {len(transactions)} transactions")
print(f"Found {len(item_stats)} unique items")
```

## Algorithm Details

### FP-Tree Construction

1. **First Scan**: Count item frequencies and filter by minimum support
2. **Sort**: Order items by frequency (descending)
3. **Second Scan**: Build FP-tree by inserting transactions
4. **Compression**: Share common prefixes in the tree structure

### Pattern Mining

1. **Bottom-up Mining**: Start with least frequent items
2. **Conditional Patterns**: Extract paths for each item
3. **Recursive Mining**: Build conditional FP-trees
4. **Pattern Growth**: Combine patterns to form larger itemsets

### Association Rules

Rules are generated from frequent itemsets using the confidence metric:
- **Confidence(A => B)** = Support(A ∪ B) / Support(A)
- Rules meeting minimum confidence threshold are returned

## Experimental Results

### Validation Results
✓ All 5 validation test suites pass successfully:
- Simple examples with expected patterns
- Classic textbook examples
- Edge cases (empty, single transaction, etc.)
- Multiple support thresholds
- Association rule generation

### Benchmark Results (5000 transactions sample)

**Support Variation (0.01 to 0.15):**
- Lower support finds more patterns (as expected)
- Execution time scales with number of patterns
- Efficient pruning at higher support thresholds

**Scalability (500 to 5000 transactions):**
- Linear time complexity with dataset size
- Consistent time per transaction (~0.5-1.5ms)
- Memory-efficient FP-tree structure

**Top Frequent Patterns:**
- Most common product combinations identified
- Association rules with high confidence
- Real-world shopping patterns discovered

See `results/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md` for detailed experimental analysis.

## Dataset Information

**Online Retail Dataset** (UCI ML Repository)
- **Source**: Transnational retail data from UK-based online store
- **Period**: 01/12/2010 - 09/12/2011
- **Transactions**: ~540,000 (after cleaning)
- **Unique Items**: ~4,000 products
- **Format**: Invoice-based transactions with product descriptions

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. Remove missing CustomerID and Description values
2. Filter negative quantities (returns/cancellations)
3. Remove zero/negative prices
4. Clean product descriptions
5. Filter non-product items (postage, fees, etc.)
6. Group by invoice to create transactions

## Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(n × m) where n = transactions, m = avg items/transaction
- **Space Complexity**: O(n × m) for FP-tree (compressed)
- **Scalability**: Linear with dataset size
- **Efficiency**: No candidate generation (unlike Apriori)
