# FP-Growth Algorithm Implementation

This project implements the **FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) algorithm** for mining frequent itemsets from transactional data using Python. The implementation is validated with small illustrative examples and benchmarked on the real-world [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Overview

The FP-Growth algorithm is an efficient method for frequent pattern mining that:
- Uses a compressed FP-tree data structure to avoid costly candidate generation
- Mines frequent itemsets through pattern fragment growth
- Is significantly faster than the Apriori algorithm for large datasets

## Features

- **Complete FP-Growth Implementation**: Full implementation of the FP-growth algorithm with FP-tree data structure
- **Memory Consumption Tracking**: Detailed memory profiling and FP-tree size metrics
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automated preprocessing pipeline for the Online Retail dataset
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Multiple test cases validating correctness
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Scalability analysis and performance metrics
- **Visualizations**: Automatic generation of performance charts and graphs

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ylc2001/ESE589-FP-growth-project.git
cd ESE589-FP-growth-project
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Basic FP-Growth Example

```python
from fp_growth import mine_frequent_itemsets

# Define transactions
transactions = [
    ['bread', 'milk'],
    ['bread', 'diaper', 'beer', 'eggs'],
    ['milk', 'diaper', 'beer', 'cola'],
    ['bread', 'milk', 'diaper', 'beer'],
    ['bread', 'milk', 'diaper', 'cola']
]

# Mine frequent itemsets
result = mine_frequent_itemsets(
    transactions, 
    min_support=0.4  # 40% minimum support
)

# Display results
print(f"Found {len(result['frequent_itemsets'])} frequent itemsets")
```

### 2. FP-Growth with Memory Tracking

```python
from fp_growth import mine_frequent_itemsets

# Mine frequent itemsets with memory tracking enabled
result = mine_frequent_itemsets(
    transactions, 
    min_support=0.4,
    track_memory=True  # Enable memory tracking
)

# Access memory statistics
mem_stats = result['memory_stats']
print(f"Peak memory: {mem_stats['peak_memory_mb']:.2f} MB")
print(f"Trees created: {mem_stats['tree_stats']['total_trees_created']}")
print(f"Max tree nodes: {mem_stats['tree_stats']['max_tree_nodes']}")
print(f"Max tree depth: {mem_stats['tree_stats']['max_tree_depth']}")
```

### 3. Run Memory Tracking Demo

See a comprehensive demonstration of memory tracking:

```bash
python demo_memory_tracking.py
```

### 2. Run Validation Tests

Validate the implementation with comprehensive test cases:

```bash
python validate.py
```

This runs 4 test suites:
- Simple transaction examples
- Classic textbook examples
- Edge cases (empty, single item, etc.)
- Support threshold variations

### 4. Run Benchmark Experiments

Run comprehensive experiments on the Online Retail dataset:

```bash
python run_benchmark.py
```

This will:
- Attempt to download and preprocess the Online Retail dataset
- If download fails (no internet), automatically use synthetic retail data
- Run support variation experiments (0.01 to 0.15)
- Run scalability experiments (500 to 5000 transactions)
- **Track memory consumption for all experiments**
- Create visualizations and save results

**Note:** The script automatically falls back to synthetic retail data if the Online Retail dataset cannot be downloaded. The synthetic data mimics real retail transactions with realistic product names and shopping patterns.

Results are saved to the `results/` directory:
- `support_variation_results.json`: Results for different support thresholds (includes memory stats)
- `scalability_results.json`: Results for different dataset sizes (includes memory stats)
- `support_variation.png`: Visualization of support experiments (includes memory plots)
- `scalability.png`: Visualization of scalability experiments (includes memory plots)
- `BENCHMARK_REPORT.md`: Comprehensive summary report with memory analysis

### 5. Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the Online Retail dataset separately:

```python
from preprocess import preprocess_online_retail

# Preprocess with 1000 transaction sample
transactions, trans_df, item_stats = preprocess_online_retail(
    sample_size=1000,
    min_items_per_transaction=2
)

print(f"Loaded {len(transactions)} transactions")
print(f"Found {len(item_stats)} unique items")
```

## Algorithm Details

### Memory Tracking

The implementation includes comprehensive memory tracking capabilities:

**Tracked Metrics:**
- **Peak Memory Usage**: Maximum memory consumed during mining
- **Memory Used**: Total memory allocated for the process
- **FP-Tree Statistics**:
  - Total number of FP-trees created (including conditional trees)
  - Maximum number of nodes in any tree
  - Maximum tree depth
  - Total memory consumed by tree structures

**Usage:**
```python
result = mine_frequent_itemsets(transactions, min_support=0.4, track_memory=True)
mem_stats = result['memory_stats']
```

**Memory Statistics Structure:**
```python
{
    'peak_memory_mb': float,      # Peak memory in megabytes
    'peak_memory_kb': float,      # Peak memory in kilobytes
    'memory_used_mb': float,      # Memory used in megabytes
    'memory_used_kb': float,      # Memory used in kilobytes
    'tree_stats': {
        'total_trees_created': int,      # Total FP-trees built
        'max_tree_nodes': int,           # Maximum nodes in any tree
        'max_tree_depth': int,           # Maximum tree depth
        'total_tree_memory_bytes': int   # Total tree memory in bytes
    }
}
```

### FP-Tree Construction

1. **First Scan**: Count item frequencies and filter by minimum support
2. **Sort**: Order items by frequency (descending)
3. **Second Scan**: Build FP-tree by inserting transactions
4. **Compression**: Share common prefixes in the tree structure

### Pattern Mining

1. **Bottom-up Mining**: Start with least frequent items
2. **Conditional Patterns**: Extract paths for each item
3. **Recursive Mining**: Build conditional FP-trees
4. **Pattern Growth**: Combine patterns to form larger itemsets

## Experimental Results

### Validation Results
✓ All 4 validation test suites pass successfully:
- Simple examples with expected patterns
- Classic textbook examples
- Edge cases (empty, single transaction, etc.)
- Multiple support thresholds

### Benchmark Results (5000 transactions sample)

**Support Variation (0.01 to 0.15):**
- Lower support finds more patterns (as expected)
- Execution time scales with number of patterns
- Efficient pruning at higher support thresholds

**Scalability (500 to 5000 transactions):**
- Linear time complexity with dataset size
- Consistent time per transaction (~0.5-1.5ms)
- Memory-efficient FP-tree structure
- Memory usage scales linearly with dataset size
- Tree depth remains stable across different scales

**Top Frequent Patterns:**
- Most common product combinations identified
- Real-world shopping patterns discovered

See `results/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md` for detailed experimental analysis.

## Dataset Information

**Online Retail Dataset** (UCI ML Repository)
- **Source**: Transnational retail data from UK-based online store
- **Period**: 01/12/2010 - 09/12/2011
- **Transactions**: ~540,000 (after cleaning)
- **Unique Items**: ~4,000 products
- **Format**: Invoice-based transactions with product descriptions

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. Remove missing CustomerID and Description values
2. Filter negative quantities (returns/cancellations)
3. Remove zero/negative prices
4. Clean product descriptions
5. Filter non-product items (postage, fees, etc.)
6. Group by invoice to create transactions

## Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(n × m) where n = transactions, m = avg items/transaction
- **Space Complexity**: O(n × m) for FP-tree (compressed)
- **Scalability**: Linear with dataset size
- **Efficiency**: No candidate generation (unlike Apriori)
